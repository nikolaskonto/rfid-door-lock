# rfid-door-lock
simple rfid-controlled relay
I got the code from https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-rfid-nfc-relay . 
For some reason, i cannot still understand, HIGH and LOW settings in the code are totally mixed up. I want the relay not to be under current when not working, extending its life. So when the code said HIGH, I replaced it with LOW and vice-versa
